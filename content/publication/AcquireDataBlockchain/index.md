abstract: Despite the Big Data Revolution, critical aspects to improve machine learning models have been overlooked concerning the benchmarked datasets and their nature that are available for the model. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based decentralised, trustless platform using “Smart Contracts” that is tailored exclusively for data collection from proficient developers and machine learning model improvement. Elastic Weighted Consolidation is used to update this model to take into account the characteristics of the incoming dataset(s) in order to avoid catastrophic forgetting, which occurs when a model only learns from fresh data and ignores its existing knowledge. A rewarding mechanism has been discussed, which ensures that low-quality data is not rewarded and good information is compensated fairly based on the improvement made to the model. It fosters a favourable environment for competition. This platform is conceived as a marketplace that provides monetary incentives for developers to partake in improving and contributing to model development.
