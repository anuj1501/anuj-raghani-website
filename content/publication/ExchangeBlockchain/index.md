abstract: Blockchain technology enables us to create ‘Smart’ contracts, capable of offering a reward in exchange for the services of skilled contributors, by contributing a trained machine learning solution for a particular dataset or specific code packages for aiding development in large projects. Leveraging the opportunities presented with this technology, in this paper, we present a proposal to deploy a system of Smart Contracts to facilitate the creation and fulfillment of collaborative agreements. The smart contract is used for automatically validating the solution, by evaluating the submissions in order of their arrival, and whether the quality requirements specified are met. The most critical advantage would be the impartial and fair evaluation of the work submitted by the prospective collaborators, with assurance for fair compensation for their efforts, wherein their payment would not be subject to subjective and manipulable factors and incentivize data contributors to refine the solution.
